This is a one of the best apps acording to a bunch of people and I agree it has bombs eggs pigs TNT king pigs and realustic stuff;1
I really enjoy this game. It's incredibly engaging and simple to pick up. The best part? It's completely free! Both children and adults will find it entertaining.;1
"What a fantastic way to pass the time! I just wish I could progress through the levels a little faster; some of them take quite a while to complete.";1
I began playing this game at 9:00 PM and lost track of time until 2:00 AM. It's a delightful challenge that appeals to both kids and adults. Truly a testament to creativity!;1
I'm completely hooked. It can be frustrating at times, but it keeps you entertained and eager for more. I understand why this game is such a massive success.;1
It functions perfectly on my Kindle Fire. I would definitely recommend it. It's enjoyable to play, with no crashes or issues. The graphics are great, and I have nothing else to add.;1
I'm addicted to this game! It even inspired me to purchase Angry Birds Star Wars. I highly recommend it.;1
I didn't even consider downloading this app because the reviews were so negative. Come on, Amazon! I look forward to the free apps you offer, and now I have to wait another day for the next one, which I hope won't disappoint like this one did. Thanks.;1
Many people are telling those who rate this app poorly to lighten up. But putting childish humor aside, the graphics are quite poor. It seems to be a 3D model pre-rendered into a series of videos that play when clicked. This method helps it run smoothly.;1
There are no ads, and while it may lack content, it keeps the kids entertained. Given how long this has been on the market, it's not surprising that it runs without lag or issues on my SGS Vibrant.;1
"Talking Tom is fantastic! I love it so much that I'm considering collecting all the ""talkers."" It's a great pick-me-up on a tough day.";1
This was one of the first apps I downloaded for my phone! It's awesome! No, I wouldn't have chosen it as a free app of the day, but it's hilarious! Stop the negativity! Talking Tom is the best!;0
Yes, this app isn't worth a penny, and I can't understand why over 250,000 people have downloaded it on the Android market. What's the point of having a few more animations in the paid version?;1
My kids have adored Tom and his friends with similar apps for months. I think many negative reviews come from people upset that the free app of the day is aimed at young children. It's not the app's fault that Amazon chose it.;1
Not for me.;1
Why don't you provide details about the updates for every app? I have an update tab for each app, but it never specifies what the update entails. Why not add a tab to show the update details?;1
"I don't understand; one app I downloaded requires Adobe AIR, but guess what? It's not supported by my Kindle's software. I really don't get it. I hope you have a better experience than I did.";1
I find it very frustrating to see so many Android products like Adobe AIR that aren't compatible with the Kindle, even though the Kindle can run many Android apps. It would be extremely helpful if Amazon would take the time to clearly state compatibility requirements.;1
As a result, I can't play any games that require it on my new tablet. I'll adjust my rating once there are support updates.;1
It won't download. Not only that, but I can't get rid of that annoying Amazon icon at the top of the screen. I've tried everything to either download it or remove it, including clearing the RAM. It disappears, but then it reappears the next time I look.;1
As I said, it won't open. I wasted money on an app that needs this to function properly, and it doesn't work.;1
"Most negative reviews stem from anti-Flash, Steve Jobs-worshipping blogs. AIR allows developers to distribute their apps across multiple devices like Android, iOS, Desktop, and TV. This isn't laziness; it's efficient development.";1
What can you say about Adobe AIR except that it's necessary to view certain content, and I had to download it?;1
"Adobe AIR isn't really an app; it's more of an operating environment, similar to Flash or Java. It does what it's supposed to do: allows AIR apps to run on your Android device. Cool!";1
It works very well with my Huawei Ascend II. Adobe is a well-known name and consistently delivers high-quality products that you can rely on. I'm very satisfied.;1
I just deleted this as soon as I got it. I didn't like it or understand it. It's up to you to decide what you want to do with it.;1
Why are people criticizing Adobe? I'd like to see more use of AIR. It does its job, just like JRE. iPhone users are just envious...;1
I like Adobe and have used it many times. It's beneficial for many of the apps you have installed. It loaded perfectly for me, and you definitely need it.;1
I have this on my phone because other apps won't work without it... and why is that again? The app does nothing on its own but takes up valuable space.;1
I'm uninstalling this app. Adobe has decided not to support Flash for Android 4.0. That's fine, but I won't support Adobe. I have an unrooted Motorola Xoom running Jelly Bean and a Samsung Galaxy S3 running ICS. I can't access any websites that require Flash.;1
I've tried several times to install/reinstall this app on my Cruz T301 tablet. It downloads but won't install. I've used chat and verbal assistance with Amazon staff to no avail. I was able to download some apps from Applanet that are not available here.;1
"It doesn't work. It keeps telling me, ""Sorry, the app store has closed."" I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it didn't work. However, it does make the puzzle games I downloaded work.";1
As soon as I installed it on my phone, all my other apps started acting buggy. I'm not sure what this app does, but I thought it would improve my Flash-dependent apps. Not so! I uninstalled it quickly to restore my phone's stability.;1
This app wouldn't function properly on my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I know the reputation of this company's software would have made it nice to install.;1
Take note: If you own an LG Optimus V, this app will not install, even if it says it is compatible on the product page. I was very disappointed. You would think this would have been resolved by now.;1
My wife couldn't figure this out at first, but I found it easy to download (in my opinion), and it was necessary to view her books. She loves it now.;1
Unfortunately, this app is not compatible with the Kindle Fire. What's worse is that, instead of explaining why it isn't compatible, you can't even view any system requirements that Adobe AIR needs to run. Also, the 3.5 Beta does not complete.;1
Any app that doesn't work on my phone gets a one-star rating. Make this app compatible with my Optimus. I hate apps that are incompatible with my phone.;1
What company in their right mind wants to pay multiple times to have their apps developed on different native platforms when they can write their code in Flex/Flash once and have it run on all platforms? Let Adobe handle the work of figuring out all the different devices.;1
I just got this to combine with another app, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works! Keep up the great work!;1
It makes apps that use it smaller and faster to download. I wish more apps utilized this, so my internal storage would be less strained!;1
From what I understand, this is sort of an operating system. I had to install this before another Android app would work. I haven't had any issues with it.;1
I understand the benefits of developing apps with AIR from a developer's perspective, but on a mobile device with limited space, it's ridiculous to require users to use extra storage just because you didn't code a native version of your app.;1
I did not order this item from here. I have no experience with it, but I need to remove it from my reviews page, so I'm writing this review. I don't know what this item does, but maybe I need it for my iPhone?;1
Whether it's Flash or PDF or anything Adobe, this app brings it to your Android device. You need this, so get it!;0
It doesn't work. It won't open. I have apps that say you need this app too, but it doesn't function. If you require this for another app to work, just delete the app.;1
Hey everyone, just a note that this app cannot install on a Velocity Micro T-301. Cheers! Dave Cooke.;1
It will not load on my Kindle HDX, and it's required for one of the games I downloaded. I can't play a game I paid for because of this issue.;1
I cannot use this on my Kindle Fire. I purchased the New York Times Crossword Puzzle, and I can't use it because it requires Adobe AIR, which won't work on my Kindle Fire. I'm very disappointed.;1
I had a lot of fun playing games with this app. It helped me with my games. Great, great, great app!;0
As always, Adobe works great and is easy to use. I haven't had any problems at all. Thanks! What else can I say?;1
"I love this app; it makes it possible for two of my other apps to work flawlessly. It's essential. Thanks!";0
Okay, I like Adobe, and I want to get this for my Kindle Fire HD, so Amazon needs to make it available so I can get it.;0
Great app! I needed it to run my Flames Live wallpaper. It worked for that. I'm not sure what else it's helping with, but it got the Flames going!;0
If I understood this, I would probably give it a four. With some purchases, you need to be very cautious.;0
Performs beautifully on both my HTC Thunderbolt and Motorola Xoom. Adobe consistently updates the framework to add features. It's one of the reasons that Android's openness is superior to Apple's closed, pay-for-everything system.;0
I utilize this icon constantly. I would definitely be lost without it. It has proven to be very beneficial and useful at the same time. It has allowed me to process and use things effectively.;1
Adobe AIR is a necessary evil sometimes. It's a pain, but not something I would like to have installed.;1
I have no use for it, even though it says I do. What exactly does it do on my Coby Tablet? I haven't been able to find out why it doesn't work. I will delete it very soon. Please find out how it helps mobile devices work.;1
All you iSheep Flash haters out there, quit complaining about it draining battery life. Update your 1.0 install to the latest version that uses hardware acceleration, and battery life issues will disappear. Or you can continue to complain about it (for another reason).;1
I would recommend Adobe products as I find them to be very useful and do the things I need to do.;0
It works very well, providing access to all sorts of content. I've used this on all my phones and tablets since it became available. There are many reasons not to buy inferior LG or other low-end hardware, and this is one of them.;1
Another bloated and insecure piece of software from Adobe. It's huge, and the performance was lackluster. Fortunately, I can remove this post completely. I wish the same was true of Flash.;0
