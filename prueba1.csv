This is a one of the best apps acording to a bunch of people and I agree it has bombs eggs pigs TNT king pigs and realustic stuff;1
This is a pretty good version of the game for being free. There are LOTS of different levels to play. My kids enjoy it a lot too.;1
this is a really cool game. there are a bunch of levels and you can find golden eggs. super fun.;1
This is a silly game and can be frustrating, but lots of fun and definitely recommend just as a fun time.;1
This is a terrific game on any pad. Hrs of fun.  My grandkids love it. Great entertainment when waiting in long lines;1
This is a very entertaining game!  You don't have to be smart to play it.  I guess that's why I like it...it's easy and fun and that's what games are suppose to be.  Be warned: this game is highly addictive.;1
this is awesome and you don't need wi ti to play trust me. it is really fun and addicting. there are like 100 levels it is even free don't waste your money on the expensive one I mean seriously. get the app;1
this is awesome I bet no one even reads the reviews because they know this game is so good that they don't need to;1
This is basicly the free version but with ads. That's actually awesome!!!! It's addicting and free at the same time really. I'd reccomend it.;1
this is by far the best free app that is available anywhere. it has helped pass the time when nothing else would do. don't pass this one up. PS I hate this 20 word minimum!;1
This is definitely a great game.  I have to get my 6-year-old grand-nephew to teach me the tricks.  I have figured out some of them, but some configurations are tough to beat.  I don't particularly care spending about 45 minutes  completing a level, but ;1
Theyve added a bunch more adds very anoying. Mi got it when it fisrt came out and now its uber adds.;0
who doesnt love this its addicting my wife wants a divorce over this game but im sticking with the birdies as an angry bird is better than an angry women great game;1
More fun now that it's on the kindle!  Fun version, nothing like the original to have some good fun with birds!;1
I love angry birds so addicting. I love it love it love it. It worth the download too fun love it;1
We have enjoyed Angry Birds Free.  It has been a lot of fun for the whole family.  Easy to use!;1
I love trying to beat this game. Kids can probably beat me at this. There is one I cannot beat. Hang'em high number 1. I haven't finished any of them, but I'll keep trying!;1
A real challenge.  I think my dad for the knowledge of construction he passed on to me.  Very helpful in collapsing those structures just to get to a frog.  Who wouldn't enjoy that?;1
My 4 year-old grandson absolutely loves it!  He plays it every time he visits me and it keeps him entertained!;1
Most people think Angry Bird is just got the kids, try it you will love the challenge of getting to the next level. I find when I'm worried about something or I have to wait for an appointment it keeps my mind occupied.;1
Measures your ability to project speed and location of the target, practice til you get it right, do not get angry, smile!;1
This game has no problems on a Kindle Fire and has very few ads.. nothing to get upset about. After all, it is the free game with advertisements! Even so, this is a game for all ages. An amazing game no doubt!!!;1
Addictive and challenging... I would recommend to anyone... Love it... Sometimes makes my brain hurt trying to figure out the strategy..;1
This  Game  is highly  addicting ,  and  a  lot if fun.  The  only thin that I didn't like  so far is the annoying  screen that  asks the user to pay  for the game  while  you are playing. Right in the  middle of the game play, it just abruptly stops  du;1
"I love angry birds. I think it is the best game in the world. everyone should play angry birds. I &lt;3 (&deg;^&deg;)";1

i love angry birds i have this for my 360 as well as my kindle fire hd! great product! ..;1
I downloaded this game last night and my daughter played until her battery died. With her kindle charged up she has been playing all morning. It's addictive.;1
The one that started the Angry Birds series, not much more to say other than fun fun fun fun fun;1
This game is awesome it a great way to pass time but hate the ads can Amazon get rid of ads without spending money? But other than that epic game:);1
Heard a lot of people talking about this crazy game and tried it. Sure is fun! I'd recommend it to anyone. Very entertaining!;1
Had never played this game but had heard all the good things about it. It IS addictive. Have got to plan time to play it or I'll play it all the time.;1
i love angry birds.  its an addicting and challenging game.  its much harder than i thought it would be but it gets you thinking along with having fun.;1
The original game was the best game of all time,  even some of the sequels were good. Now the more recent games with the Power Ups have ruined it.. It's no longer worthy of best game... Should have left it alone.. It was a good thing,  was;0
VERY INTERESTING TO ME AND GOOD FOR KIDS.  I LOVE THIS GAME JUST STARTED PLAYING IT, BUT IT IS MY FAVORITE GAME.  I LOVE THOSE BIRDS.;1
grand kids play when on a trip well worth the down load thinks it is awesome would get more fast;1
Angry Birds is fun to play and can be somewhat challenging.  This is a good sample of the games you can play.;1
This game is full of variety, but I find some of the levels frustrating , which is a pain!Sorry for that.;1
Everyone loves this game  It is addicting once you play it you cannot stop one of the best free apps;1
This is the rating from my 6 year old who has been doing Angry Birds for years now!It is fun for me too, when he lets me play!;1
When I first got my Kindle Fire, I got several games for my grandkids to play -- this one is the only one they will ask to play.  It is also a hit with my hubby!;1
Angry birds was the first non console or hand held game I have ever played. It was fun from the instant I played it. You just want to keep playing until you can get those snarky pigs! The gameplay is easy. You use your fingers to launch birds across the ;1
good fun for whole family, keeps you on your toes trying to get to other levels , just an all around fun game to play.;1
This game is so addicting! There are a few little issues, like the birds not doing what they are supposed  to do when I tap on the screen, but it happens rarely. Awesome game! Can't wait to get the next one :-);1
I just wanted a game for my Kindle. It is easy to learn and it can be played any where and at any time.;1
Yes!! These birds laugh at me when I miss them so it just makes me want to get them more. I love the way this game is strategy plus entertainment for me.;1
I love this game I play it almost every day and highly recommend this game to all people who have a device that can get this game.;1
This is a fun game and it is hard to stop playing it.  I rated it 5 stars and would recommend to everyone.;1
I always loved this game, but I'm horrible at it. Anyone give Angry Birds lessons? I'll be the first to sign up!;1
I like playing this game.  It can be addictive to try and get to the next level all the time.;1
Another one of my grandson and granddaughters favorites. young and old at my house like this game. It is fun;1
Great little game for the kids and its free, i like to play it sometimes myself try it if you don't like it you haven't blown yor gaming budget;1
I couldn't believe how this game drew me in.  I quickly played all the levels, but then started back through to achieve 3 stars on all levels.  some of them are proving to be a real challenge.  This uses up lots of time, but is hard to put down.;1
my daughter gets these games, I think thier okay, but she loves them, whatever makes yr kids happy, so they will leave you alone for a little while is okay with me.;1
My wife plays this game on her Kindle and really likes it.  She recommends it to anyone who plays computer games.;1
I think everyone has played this by now.  Ad supported version, a little annoying but not a serious enough game to get in the way.;1
Great way to pass the time.....very addictive and as a free app, I have fun trying to increase my score!;1
This game is great fun and has its own culture with it.  I didn't get it at first but after playing it for a short time it is very addictive.  Next thing I know it is 1am and I have to shut it off to get some sleep.;1
My 4 year old Grandson was having so much fun showing me how to play it on his mini IPad that I decided to see if I could get it on my Kindle Fire!  I found this, and he spent the night w/ me and I showed it to him, and he liked it better than the one he;1
Who does not love this game! And it is free.. If you have never played angry birds then try this one and you will see what all the fuss is about!!;1
Once I start playing this game,it is hard to stop. I get caught up it and forget about everything else.;1
Angry Birds is one of the first apps we place on my whole families devices.  This is a #1 game at my house.;1
I have angry birds on every device I own and I love to play it although I'm not really that great at the game although I still love to play it.;1
It's Angry Birds. Probably the most famous phone/tablet game in existence. You're going to enjoy it so you might as well just download it.;1
I am so addicted to this game. Even when I can't beat the level and have to use the eagle, I will go back and keep trying when I am waiting for the eagle to come up again, or get frustrated with the level I was on before...;1
I am so glad angry bird are coming out with different themes like space and beach scenes. My son loves them all.;1
I love this game but because it's free they are a lot of advertisements which come on between every level or so so it's a little annoying but not so much. Download it.;1
Everyone love this game and its very addicted game ever! I cannot stop playing this game! Great graphic and everything!;1
I like it but reds mighty feathers is lost by that I mean they added a horrible update its it was unique now it's like any other level;1
This program has a problem opening once installed successfully. Tried deleting and reinstalling to no avail. I would like to know, what else can I do?;1
We loved playing Angry Birds on my mom's iPad, so when I got a kindle fire I was pleased to see that there was a free Angry Birds app for kindle. =)  Love playing it when I have some time to kill, and the kids love it, too.  However, playing on the kindl;1
Who doesn't like angry birds? This was the first game on my kindle and remains one of my favorites. Fun!;1
first time I have played!Very addictive!Would recommend to others to get this app!The Star Wars one is fun too!;1
Kind of boring - the novelty has worn off.  I've already  removed it from the tablet. All set with it.;0
I tried this game because everyone said how much fun it was.  I didn't care for the game and that's the reason for my rating.;0
i always am playing this game it is so much fun it is addicting to play i love it so much;1
Wow, this is a ver funny and fun game.  I start to play and just can not put this away for the day.;1
Fun game.  You can play for hours.  I like the sounds they make.  I love it when I accidently send the little fellows backwards!!!;1
Like the game but kinda moved on to other apps. Maybe, return at a later date. Love the big black birds that blow everything up.;1
Addictive game. Wish I would have came up the idea of Angry Birds. Wish they would update to add more levels.;1
It's hard to say I love it when those miserable pigs keep smiling and blinking at me!  It's still fun.;1
Nice game. I have never played Angry Birds before. So, when I purchased my tablet, one of the first games I downloaded was this. It can become very addictive in a very short amount of time. Nice way to waste some spare time.;1
I love this game!!!  The graphics and music are fun.  It makes me smile.  It's no surprise that it's so popular;1
Great Graphics works great on my kindle fire hd love all the levels. wish I could get it to connect with facebook;1
This game is addictive - the harder you try, the more you want to beat it.  Good for all ages.;1
Everyone is playing this game....it is a lot of fun and hours of entertainment.  It can be frustrating at some levels but it  makes you want to accomplish the levels....truly a fun game.  Strategy is needed...offers some learning as well.  I think everyh;1
The neat thing about Angry Birds is that there is so much variety in the game. You never get tired of it!;1
Well I have never played Angry Birds, but my son sure loves it. If he's happy then so am I!;1
This is an addicting game - lot's of fun.  I find the games quite challenging.  This is the firsttime I had played the game - grandkids play it all the time on their I-pods.;1
We have Angry Birds on every tablet and phone we own. It's addicting and super fun to knock down those smug piggies!;1
Ads are not annoying because they only pop up once in awhile unlike other games where they pop up after each round played.;1
Easy to get hooked on this complete waste of time....but it is one of two of the most enjoyable games I play.;1
I really like angry birds.  It is so cute.  This also is a great purchase.  All ages can enjoy this game.;1
my 5 yr old love this game, he play it almost all the time it's his favorite game, personally I don't play it, but i think its kool.;1
I love this game! There are very few ads. The update is amazing! I love the new levels! Go birds!!;1
It's easy for my grandkids to pick up the skills needed to play this game. Good for quiet time or rainy days.;1
This is another great game and fun to play.  I can play for as long or as short a time as I have available and still have fun.;1
Could not play it and would like you too fix it so it would work so someone could play it.;0
i think that it is awesome to play on the kindle i like playing it and it is a good pass time when you are waiting;1
I love this app.  It's so much fun to play and easy to learn.  Best of all, it's free.  Kids and adults alike will like this one.;1
What a wonderful time suck.  I just wish I could pass the levels a bit quicker.  It takes a bit to get through some of them.;1
I started playing this game at 9:00 pm and couldn't stop until 2:00 am.  It's a fun challenge that kids and adults alike can enjoy.  Creativity at it's best!;1
I'm hooked.  Drives me nuts but keeps you entertained and coming back for more.  I see why this is such a bif hit.;1
Works well on kindle fire.  Would recommend.  Fun to play.  No lock ups.  Good graphics.  Nothing else to add to this.;1
I am addicted to this game.It made me go out and buy Angry Birds Star Wars.I highly recommend it.;1
I didn't even bother to download this app because the reviews were so poor. Come on Amazon. I look forward to the free apps you're offering and now I have to wait another day for the next one which will hopefully not let me down like this one. Thanks.;0
Many people are telling those how rate this app poorly to lighten up. But childish and immature attempts humor aside, the graphics on this are terrible. Its a 3d model prerendered to a series of videos that initiate when clicked.This method helps it run ;0
No ads and although lacking in content,  keeps the kids entertained. Given the amour of time this has been on the market,  it not surprisingly works without lag or problems on my sgs vibrant.;1
"Talking Tom,Liked so much,I'm thinking of collecting all the &#34;talkers&#34;. Really great when you need a little &#34;pickup&#34; on a down day.";1
One of the first apps I dl for my phone!  This app is awesome!  No,  I would not have made it a free app of the day but this is funny as heck! Stop ur hating!  Talking Tom rules!;1
yes this app doesn't really worth a penny and I don't know why there is over 250k people downloaded it on android market. what is the point of having some more animation with this paid version?;0
My kids have loved Tom and many of his friends who have similar apps for months. I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people who are upset that the free app of the day is targeted towards little kids. It's not the app's fault that Amazon;1
not for me;0
Why Don't you post what the update is for every app I have there's an update tab when it needs to be updated but it never says what the update is, why don't you put a tab on there to show what the update is;1
I dont get it, one app i had dowload, requires this adobe air, but wess wat, it does not soported by the software of the kindle... i realy dont understand, hope you have better expirence of this;0
I have found it very annoying to find so many Android products likeAdobe AIRthat are not compatible with Kindle, even though the Kindle can run a large number of Android apps.  It would be VERY helpful if you (Amazon) would take the time to CLEARLY state;0
Therefore I can't play any of the games that require it on my new tablet. I'll fix the rating when there's support updates.;0
Wont download.  Not only that I cant get rid of that annoying Amazon icon at the top of the screen.  I have tried just about everything to either download it or get rid of it including clearing the ram.  It disappears then the next time I look its back a;0
like i said, won't open. i wasted money on an app that needs this to work properly and it doesn't work.;0
Most negative reviews are based of anti-flash, Steve job worshipping blogs. AIR allows developers to distribute their app on multiple devices such as Android, iOS, Desktop and TV. This not lazy but efficient development.;1
What can you say about Adobe Air except that it is required to view some things and I had to download it.;1
Adobe Air is not really an app but, rather, an operating environment kinda like Flash or Java or a number of different requirements. It does what it is supposed to do: allow Air apps to operate on your Android.  Cool!!;1
Works very well with Huawei Ascend II. Adobe is a well recognized name & always delivers top quality products that you can depend on. Very satisfied.;1
I just deleted this once I got it.  Did not like it or understand it also.  It is up to you to decide what you want to do with it.;0
Why are people hating on Adobe?  I'd like to see more use of AIR.  It does it's job, just like JRE.  iPhone users are just jealous...;1
I like adobe and have used it many times. It's good for so many of the apps you have installed.  It loaded great for me and you definitely need it.;1
I have this on my phone because other apps won't work without it... and why is *that* again? The app does nothing, on it's own, but consume valuable space.;0
I am uninstalling this app. Adobe wants to not support flash for Android 4.0. That is fine. I will not support Adobe. I have a un-rooted Motorola Xoom running Jelly Bean and the Samsung Galaxy S3 which is running ICS. I can't view any websites that have ;0
in order to play some games and apps I had to download this add-on it works doesn't lock up my phone, and I guess it just does what it needs to do.;1
I have Adobe Air on my pc at home and my tablet.  It has never crashed on me but keeps things running smooth.;1
I have tried several times to install/reinstall this app on my Cruz T301 tablet...it will download, but will not install.  Have used chat and verbal assistance with Amazon staffers to no avail.  Was able to download some apps from Applanet that are not d;0
Doesn't work. Keeps telling me, sorry the app store has closed. Tried u install and re-installed. Didn't work. But it is making the puzzle games i d/l it for, work.;0
As soon as I installed it on my phone all my other apps starting acting buggy. I'm not sure what this app does but I thought it would make my Flash dependent apps work better. No so! I uninstalled very quickly to restore the stableness of my phone.;0
This app would not function properly on my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I know the ranking of this particular company's software would have made it nice to have been able to install. Time will get them there.;0
I find this one of many applications that are needed to play and run your games and apps, both on my tablet and my computers.;1
Take Note:  If you own an LG Optimus V, this app will not install even if it says it is compatible on the product page.  I was very disappointed.  You would think this would have been ironed out by now.;0
The wife couldn't figure this out at first but it's an easy download (in my opinion) and was required to view her books. She loves it now.;1
Unfortunately, this app is not compatible with the Kindle Fire. What's worse is that, instead of explaining why it is not compatible, you are not even able to view any system requirements that Adobe AIR needs to run. Also, the 3.5 Beta does not complete ;0
any app that does not work on my phone gets a one star rating, make this app compatible with optimus. I hate apps that are incompatible with my phone;0
What company in their right mind wants to pay multiple times to have their apps developed on multiple native platforms. When they can write their sin Flex/Flash once and have them run on all the platforms. Let Adobe do the work of figuring out all the di;1
JUST GOT THIS 2COMBINE WITH OTHER APP,BUT WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH HOW GREAT IT WORKS! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!;1
Makes apps that use it smaller and a faster download. I wish more apps used this, so my internal storage would be smaller!;1
From what I understand, this is sort of an operating system.  I had to install this before another Android app would work.  I've not had any problems with it.;1
I understand the benefits of developing apps with air from a developer's standpoint, but on a mobile device with limited space, it's ridiculous to require users to eat up extra storage so you can be lazy enough to not code a native version of your app.;0
I did not order this item from here.  I have no experience with it but I need to get it off my Reviews page so I'm writing this review.  I don't know what this item does, but maybe I need it for my iPhone?;1
Be it flash or PDF or anything adobe this app brings it to your Android device. You need this so Get it;1
Does not work.  Won't open.  Have apps that say you have to have this app too but it does not work.  If you require this for another app to work just delete the app.;0
Hey All,Just a note that this app cannot install on a Velocity Micro T-301.Cheers!Dave Cooke;0
Will not load on my kindle hdx and it is required for one of the games I loaded. I cannot play a game I paid for due to this problem.;0
I cannot use this on my kindle fire.  I purchased the New York times Crossword Puzzle and I can't use it as it requires adobe air and it won't work with my kindle fire.  I am very disappointed.;0
Had a lot of fun playing games with this app. It helped me with my games. Great, great, great app.;1
As always Adobe works great, easy to use. Havent had any problems at all. Thanks .. What else can I say ?;1
I love this app it makes possible for two of my other apps to word flawlessly. Trouble without it. thanks.;1
ok i like adobe and i whont to get this for my kindle fire hd so amazon needs to get to it so i can get it;0
Great app! Needed it to run my Flames Live wallpaper. It worked for that. Not sure what else it is helping, but it got the Flames going!;1
If I understood this, I would probably give it a four.  With some purchases, you need to be very cautious.;0
"performs beautifully on both my HTC Thunderbolt and Motorola Xoom. Adobe is consistently updating the framework to add features. It&apos;s one of the options that makes Android openness superior to Apple&apos;s closed, pay for everything system.";1
I utilze this icon on a constant basis. I would definitely be lost without it. It has proving to be very beneficial and useful at the same time. It have me to be able to processed and use things effectively.;1
Adobe AIR is a pain in the butt. A necessary evil sometimes. But not what I would like to have installed.;0
I have no use for it even though it says I do. What exactly does it do on Coby Tablet? I haven't been able to find out why it doesn't work. I will delete it very soon. Please find out how it helps the mobile equipment work.;0
All you iSheep flash haters out there quit complaining about it burning battery life.  Update your 1.0 install to the latest version that uses hardware acceleration, and battery life issues go away. Or you can sit around and complain about it (for anothe;1
I would recommend Adobe products as I find them to be most useful and do the things I need to do.;1
works very well, gives access to all sorts of stuff. I've used this on all my phones/tablets since it became available. there are many reasons not to buy inferior LG or other low end hardware, this is one of them.;1
Another bloated and insecure piece of software from Adobe. It's huge. The performance was lackluster. Fortunately I can remove this Post completely. I wish the same was true of Flash.;0
